# ✅ Todo app

A lightweight yet functional todo application that helps you stay organised.

## 🧰 Why I Built This Tool

A to-do list is a great project to challenge myself because it involves all CRUD operations. Creating, reading, updating, and deleting todos allowing me to practice full data flow in a simple, real-world context.

## ✨ Features

-   Create todos
-   Mark todos as complete
-   Delete todos
-   Local storage persistence
-   Dark/Light mode toggle

## 🚀 Usage

1. Enter a new task in the input field and add it to your list
2. Mark tasks as complete when done
3. Delete tasks you no longer need
4. Toggle between dark and light mode
5. Todos will be saved automatically in local storage
